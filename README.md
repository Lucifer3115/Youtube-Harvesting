# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

## Introduction
YouTube, the online video-sharing platform, has revolutionized the way we consume and interact with media. This project focuses on extracting data from specific YouTube channels, processing and storing it in a MongoDB database, and optionally migrating it to MySQL for further analysis.
